Make-a-Thing: Design Reflection

For my "Make-a-Thing" project, I created a very short text-based game using Ink, a narrative scripting language. The game is simple, but using something new like Ink is always a cool experience.

What Worked:
Ink's structure made it easy to set up branching choices quickly. Commands like * for choices and -> for directing the flow helped me keep everything organized, even with a short story.

What Didn't Work:
The syntax was a bit tricky at first. Ink's formatting is different from other coding languages I've used like Javascript or Python, and understanding how to use commands like === (sections), -> DONE (end of a path), and -- (non-branching outcomes) took some getting used to and was a bit confusing. Even small mistakes, like misplacing an indent, caused issues.

Reflection:
Although the game is short, it was a good introduction to interactive storytelling. I learned how to use Ink's basic features, like creating choices with * and adding sub-choices with * *. I’d like to explore more of Ink’s features, like tracking player decisions or adding conditions, in future projects.

Quick Syntax Notes:
->: Directs the flow to a specific section.
===: Marks the start of a new section.
*: Creates a choice.
* *: Adds a sub-choice.
--: Non-branching outcomes.
-> DONE: Ends a sequence or path.
-> END: Ends the story completely.
Here’s a screenshot of Ink’s interface and the short game interaction I made:

#Play tested in-class and people liked it more than expected. It was just something to get started with, so I will expand on it in the future.
